                        My biggest hobby by far is gaming. It has always been a part of my life since I was 4 years old and received an NES for Christmas in 1989. I run a small twitch channel that can be found at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/chucktowntiger"> twitch.tv/chucktowntiger </a>. 
                        I play a variety of games and use them as a way to keep in touch with old friends who are no longer located near by! Some of my current favorite games include Escape from Tarkov, League of Legends, Rocket League, and Retro Games as well.

                    <p>
                        No hobby list is complete without also relaxing on the couch with a drink in one hand and a show on the TV. Some of my favorites include about anything from the Star Wars universe including the cartoon series! I am extremely excited for the upcoming Obi Wan show.
                        He is by far my favorite character from the Star Wars Universe. I enjoy the Witcher and other "nerdy" shows along with a lot of crime dramas and about anything serial killer related. Recently I have started watching a few anime shows that were recommended to me by friends.

                    <p>
                        I also enjoy putting together Legos with my son. I have built many of the space related ones such as the Saturn V, ISS, Apollo Lander and the Space Shuttle! I also own a few of the Star Wars sets as well. My 6 year old is also getting into
                        Legos these days and building them with him has been a blast! I also have built a few Military style "Legos" from an alternative brand called Cobi!

                    <p>
                        When I have a chance I also enjoy playing golf and have started to get my son into it as well. I am pretty terrible but it is good to get out doors and move around when I am usually couped up inside an office for most of the day!
